CHAPTER I
 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Project Overview

CCIS-CodeHub is a comprehensive learning management system designed specifically for Computer Science and Information Technology students at the College of Computer and Information Sciences (CCIS). The system provides an integrated platform that combines dynamic learning modules with AI-powered mentoring, automated content generation, real-time gamified assessments, community collaboration, project management, and real-time progress tracking. The primary target users include CCIS students (BSIT, BSCS, BSIS programs), instructors, and administrators who require a modern, interactive educational environment that bridges theoretical learning with practical application through AI assistance and peer collaboration.

1.2 Background of the Study

At Surigao del Norte State University (SNSU), students enrolled in the College of Computing and Information Sciences (CCIS) programs—Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), and Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS)—face challenges common to computing education worldwide. Traditional learning management systems in educational institutions often lack the integration of modern AI technologies for automated content delivery and fail to provide personalized learning experiences that adapt to individual student needs (Holmes et al., 2019; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019). CCIS students frequently struggle with complex programming concepts, algorithms, database design, and other technical subjects without immediate access to personalized guidance beyond regular class hours, leading to decreased engagement and academic performance (Robins et al., 2003; Watson & Li, 2014). Moreover, existing systems typically operate in silos, separating theoretical learning content from collaborative project work and community interaction, which limits CCIS students' development of essential teamwork and communication skills required in the technology industry (Dillenbourg, 1999; Stahl et al., 2006).

The motivation for developing CCIS-CodeHub stems from the specific needs of SNSU CCIS students who require a unified platform that leverages artificial intelligence to provide 24/7 mentoring support tailored to Information Technology, Computer Science, and Information Systems curricula (Luckin et al., 2016). The system integrates collaborative learning through community features that enable CCIS students to share knowledge, help peers, and build professional networks within their academic programs (Kreijns et al., 2003), while combining theoretical learning with practical project management experience relevant to their chosen fields (Kolb, 2014). This system specifically addresses the gap between traditional educational delivery methods at SNSU and the dynamic, interactive learning environment that CCIS students in BSIT, BSCS, and BSIS programs require to succeed in their academic pursuits and future careers in the rapidly evolving technology industry (Siemens, 2005; Vygotsky, 1978).
